# Multiple-index interaction models (MIIM) for environmental mixtures
Example R codes for MIIM with simulated datasets.
In 'MIIM_analysis.R', there are functions for MIIM as follows:
'si': MIIM for continuous and categorical outcomes under generalized linear model framework
'si_surv': MIIM for survival outcome under Cox proportional hazards model framework
'si.gl': MIIM with hierarchical variable selection using Lasso penalties for each group (example for continuous and categorical outcomes)
